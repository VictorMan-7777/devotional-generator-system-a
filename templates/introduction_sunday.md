# Sunday Worship Integration

This devotional is designed to accompany your week — six days of personal reading,
reflection, and prayer, followed by a seventh day that extends into your Sunday worship.

Day 7 works in two movements. Before you leave for worship, you will find a short
reflection to carry with you into the service — a thread connecting the week's theme
to the communal gathering. After the service, two tracks invite you to respond to
what you heard.

**Track A** is for when the sermon touched the same territory as this week's theme.
Use it when the preached word deepened, confirmed, or challenged what you read and
prayed through during the week.

**Track B** is for when the sermon went somewhere else entirely. The Holy Spirit
moves in the congregation as he will, and a divergent sermon is not a disconnected
one. Track B gives you space to hold both — the week's private thread and the public
word — and let God weave them together in his own time.

On Day 6 you will find a short *Sending Prompt* at the close of the day. It is a
bridge — a word to carry into Sunday.

Neither track is better than the other. Convergence and divergence are equally valid
forms of Spirit-led formation. Attend to what you heard. Notice what stirred.
